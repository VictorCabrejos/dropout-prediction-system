### Prediction API

```
POST /api/predict
```

**Request Body**:

```json
{
  "age_at_enrollment": 20,
  "curricular_units_1st_sem_enrolled": 6,
  "curricular_units_1st_sem_approved": 5,
  "curricular_units_2nd_sem_enrolled": 6,
  "curricular_units_2nd_sem_approved": 5,
  "unemployment_rate": 10.8
}
```

**Response**:
